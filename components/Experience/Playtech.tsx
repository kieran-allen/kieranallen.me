        As a UI Developer at Playtech I work extensively with data heavy
        customer facing React.JS applications. My team follow the scrum
        methodology with week long sprints and daily stand-up meetings to inform
        others on work done. As part of my team I carry out daily code reviews
        to ensure quality of code across all applications is maintained.
      </p>
      <p>Some projects I have worked on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implemented localised date and number formatting for clients using the
          react-intl library. This feature greatly improved the user experience
          for clients located outside the United Kingdom.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed a native fetch component to handle all of the applications
          api requests, thus removing any need for JQuery in our build.
        </li>
        <li>
          Successfully reworked our redux store to be used across all
          applications instead of using separate stores for each application.
          This greatly simplified our codebase and cut down on a lot of
          duplicate code.
        </li>
      </ul>
