          , which has resulted in a significant increase in transactions. The
          page is now used by 2000+ customers daily, which has had a positive
          impact on the companys bottom line. In addition, the page has been
          well-received by customers, with many positive reviews.

          which makes it easy for customers to integrate an open banking
          payments flow into their website. The SDK handles all the necessary
          authentication and authorization, so all the customer needs to do is
          integrate the SDK into their website and add a few lines of code to
          enable the open banking payments flow.

          I worked on integrating MSW into the Truelayer hosted payments page
          project. This made testing easier and Frontend development quicker
          when reliant on backend changes.
