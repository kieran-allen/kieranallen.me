        As a Frontend Developer at OVO Energy I work as part of a team to
        acquire new customers and retain current customers through our
        Acquisition and Renewal flows. I work primarily with AngularJS and
        ReactJS, both of which leverage the TypeScript library in order to
        create safer code.
      </p>
      <p>Some projects I have worked on include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Migration of the OVO acquisition frontend from AngularJS to ReactJS.
          <ul>
            <li>73% decrease in time to interactive.</li>
            <li>36% reduction in Javascript package size.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>

          </ul>
        </li>
