      <p>
        I&apos;ve been working as a frontend developer for a number of years
        now, and in that time I&apos;ve become skilled in a number of different
        technologies. I have a strong foundation in JavaScript, and I&apos;m
        also experienced with ReactJS, Redux, ReactQuery, TailwindsCSS and
        NextJS. I&apos;m always looking to improve my skills and learn new
        technologies, so that I can provide the best possible experience for my
        users. Outside of work, I enjoy cycling and playing video games. I am
        very interested in the potential that cryptocurrencies have to change
        the way that we think about money and finance.
